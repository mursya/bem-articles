# JavaScript in BEM: Basic Concepts

Included in BEM's full-stack is a block called [i-bem](http://bem.
github.io/bem-bl/sets/common-desktop/i-bem/i-bem.en.html) which 
lives in the [bem-bl](http://bem.github.io/bem-bl/) block-library.
`i-bem`'s Javascript is designed for the `BEM Application environment`
and is the Javascript code which allows one to take full advantage of 
designing code using BEM Principles not only in design of components,
but also their behavior.
